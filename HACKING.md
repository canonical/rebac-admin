## Prettier in VS Code

To use Prettier in VS Code you will need to enable the IDE SDKs. This is
required because this project uses Yarn PnP and TypeScript. For more details see
[the docs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks).

To enable the SKDs run the following command from the repo root:

```bash
yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
```
